# MockBillingSystem

This is a really simple billing system. Currently it supports only hourly billing but can easily be extended ;)

# Getting started 

  1. Pull repo
  2. Run composer install
  3. Run specs with `php bin/phpspec run` 
  4. Process input file (e.g input.json) with `php bootstrap.php input.json`
